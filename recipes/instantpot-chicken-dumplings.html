        <p style="max-width: 600px;">I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of flavor and ease of preparation I was looking for! It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker rather than an oven.</p>

        <h3>Dumplings: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
            </li>
            <li>
                Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool slightly; discard bay leaf.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture is the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add peas and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by heaping spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low, covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a dumpling should come out clean.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
        <p>If you want to use this as a pot pie filling, decrease the chicken broth to 2 cups.If you have a mini food processor, it's perfect for step 5. Transfer the flour-butter mixture to a bowl before proceeding.</p>
